		<p>HIFA is a 6-day annual festival and workshop programme that showcases the very best of local, regional and international arts and culture in a comprehensive festival programme of theatre,dance, music, circus, street performance, fashion, spoken word and visual arts. HIFA has come to be seen as an important symbol of something positive about Zimbabwe, unifying socially and culturally disparate groups of Zimbabweans at a time of ideological conflict and political uncertainty bringing huge audiences together to celebrate something positive – the healing and constructive capacity of the arts.</p>
		<p>Since its inception in 1999, the Festival has received recognition for its support of arts and culture in Zimbabwe and is seen as a major contributor to development in this area. HIFA is now the largest cultural event in Zimbabwe and among the eight major festivals in Africa. HIFA has gained local and international media praise on many fronts, for example, Robert Grieg writing in the South Africa Sunday Independent -“The Harare International Festival of the Arts is probably the best organised festival in the sub-continent and one of the most manageably diverse. More importantly in the current socio-economic situation HIFA has come to be seen as an important symbol of something positive about Zimbabwe”.</p>

			<p>New Years celebrations in Victoria Falls have dated back decades,and have now evolved from humble beginnings to one of Africa's largest New Years Celebrations.

	In 1855 when David Livingstone decided to toast to the queen at the turn of the New Year the spirit of celebration was established in Zimbabwe. The first formal music festival in Vic Falls started in 2009 with Falls Fest, which continued until 2011 when it became the legendary Vic Falls Carnival! Now with Jameson onboard this unforgettable festival gets better every year.

	For 2016 the Jameson Vic Falls Carnival schedule has been updated. The 29th of December will see Vic Falls come alive with a variety of community parties including a Beach Party at Shoestrings lodge and more to be announced, the 30th sees the Train and Bush party return and the 31s of December welcomes an epic line-up of artists at the New Year's concert. #JVFC2016 is for everyone; the music festival showcases artists from all over Southern Africa, and caters for all musical tastes as long as you are ready to party into the New Year. LIVE THE ADVENTURE this New Year and join us at One Of The Seven Wonder's Of The World as we ring in 2017! </p>
